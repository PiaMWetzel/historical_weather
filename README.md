## IsItHotToday

#### Doesn't it sometimes happen that you wonder if today is particularly cold/hot or if it's just you?

**IsItHotToday** shows users how today's temperature highs and lows compare to historical data.  
The user sees the hottest and coldest highs and lows, a scatterplot with current and past data,  
and how today's data compares - e.g. `Today is 66.7% hotter than previous October 8s`

Right now, the page concentrates on data of only one reporting station (downtown Los Angeles, near USC).   
The medium-term goal is it to include reporting stations in all of southern California.
